Gender is a web of relations that ensnares us all, determining to a certain extent what we do, value, think, love, what emotions we feel, even what we consider reality. Often this is cashed out in terms of gender determining our politics, our views on truth and justice, or more broadly as a modifier for all our actions. I think cashing that out in this way is weak and obscures the genuinely terrifying corollary of the above statement: ____ While I agree with Butler that Gender is probably best understood as a continuous series of daily performances, one is of course not free to perform in any way one wants, both because what ways one could perform in have already been limited by the gendered experiences one has made in the past, and also because certain gendered experiences are not appreciated by society. These don't have to be stark, either: Merely sideways glances might be enough for you to reconsider your gender expression. This, then, is the theoretical groundwork. I will in the rest of this post explore my personal discontents with gender, especially my dissatisfaction with the gendered relations to other people.

## The Background: Corona-Lockdown and Old Friends

Not doing something for a long time generally allows for a new perspective on it. Such it was that when I met some old friends in Summer of 2020, I hadn't physically met with friends for four months. My old friends are generally relatively centrist in their beliefs, they are, for lack of a better term, relatively 'normal'. In a sense, in meeting them, nothing happened. We ate, drank, played games, the like. One person wanted to make a sexist comment, to which I objected, but otherwise nothing particularly negative happened. However, it's the small moments where I felt myself being pulled, but also pushing myself into relations I might not really want to embody: In a room full of masculine bodies and only one feminine one, I suddenly felt regret for not having worked out more during the lockdown, as I felt I had lost the status of "one of the more ripped members of this social group." I found myself engaging in small talk that had a distinctly masculine character: The kind where you talk about topics such as working out and involves a lot of nodding, 'for sure', and the like. Likewise, it was clear that for some of the present, they were unhappy with not 'measuring up', whether that be to others in the group or the society at large. Perhaps more than that it was however defined by a lack of something that has never been present: Although the tone in general was mostly warm and friendly, I hesitate to call it loving. It has often been observed that in (heterosexual) male-male interactions there is a boundary to emotional and physical intimacy that is acceptable. In general, I believe myself to be a person willing to buck gender norms, as I feel I do often. And indeed: Even at this gathering, I tried my best to be cute when I wanted to be, ___, and vulnerable when I wanted to be. This gathering made me realize (as in hindsight is obvious) that there are group norms that you cannot buck, as they are not negative rules (i.e. rules disincentivizing you from doing something) targeting you, but a lack of positive desire towards certain things. Perhaps more importantly, I realized while contemplating this that while desiring this intimacy even outside romantic or sexual relationships, I do not desire it with male(-looking) bodies. More confusingly, *I do not desire it as a male body*.

## Trans, Genderqueer, and Cute Girls Doing Cute Things

That sounds a lot like someone that is trans\* or genderqueer would say - and those labels might apply to me, though I do not know. However, in my research for my [Otaku and Lolicon paper](2020-06-29-japan-otaku-patriarchy.html), I came across many consumers of shoujo ((for) girls) manga and bishoujo (cute/beautiful girl) characters who felt intense passion for these stories and characters not because they were attracted to these characters, but because they *wanted to be these characters.* Hayao Miyazaki fn:{Famous anime filmmaker, amongst many others he directed *Princess Mononoke*, *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*, *The Castle in the Sky*. He is known for his female protagonists} explained this as follows: <q> This type of youth [young males, mentioned before] begins to feed the girl within himself. The girl is part of him, and a projection of himself… These girls express nostalgia for a self that was free of the detritus of life. The girl is not living outside of him; she is the very self that he has nurtured inside himself. </q> This desire to be 'a girl', as opposed to similar concepts of 'feminine' or 'a woman', is something that resonates with me. So why would one want to be 'a girl', especially an anime girl? Let's explore.

## Tentative Conclusion

Now, these are of course idealized portraits that probably don't mirror the lived experiences of 'real girls', much less adult women, who of course face similar social norms related to being an adult, seeming cool, and the like. fn:{Of course, I have no direct insight into this either way, so I might be hilariously wrong} Yet, I nonetheless feel that there is a gendered component: It seems to me close to *impossible* to have such a relationship while identifying as male: As touched on before, probably due to continued exposure to the societal discomfort with male-male intimacy, I wouldn't *want* such intimacy with men, and such intimacy with women automatically is riddled with questions about sexuality, where each action hypersignfies. fn:{For anyone wanting the lived experience of all these problems burned into your memory, visit your local cuddle party} And even within romantic relationships, there seems to be too much *meaning* to such actions for it to represent the intimacy depicted above, which seems to me *both* casual and deep. Why anime tends to depict such relationships and intimacy frequently is a question for another essay. My question, to myself and to others, is: If we think this is desirable, what can we do about it?

 As I am wont to do, I told a few anecdotes, one of which involved showing around a picture of me in full makeup (In which I am very cute), which drew suprise, bemusement, and one person shaking their head.
