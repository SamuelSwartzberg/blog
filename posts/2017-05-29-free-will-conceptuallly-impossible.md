title|The Conceptual Confusion of Free Will
date|29.05.2017
abstract|Often, people arguing for the existence of free will will often appeal to physics, to the soul, or to agent causality. Here I will attempt to prove, that in an incompatibilist world, libertarian free will is not just impossible, but the idea is conceptually confused.

## Premises

1. We will disregard compatibilism for now, as it doesn't influence strict libertarian free will.
2. We will disregard true randomness. This is because, as should seem intuitively apparent, true randomness doesn't give actors any more control, it just shifts the cause of un-freedom.

## Definitions

1. **Libertarian free will**: There exist actions that are completely free.
2. **Hard Determinism**: Every event has a cause. Nothing else than what happened could have happened.
3. **Free action**: An action is free if the agent could have done otherwise.
4. **Agent causation**: The idea that an agent can start a new chain of causality.

## The physicalist argument

For now, let's assume the world is physicalist, that is, there are no things but physical things. We'll come back to the non-physical possibilities later. Then, an assumption we can safely make is that the physical world is determined by physical laws. (Discounting randomness, as we have) Since we're committed to physicalism, our bodies, including our brain, are completely physical. Therefore our brains mental states are reducable to brain states, which are reducable to physical states. So, every thought we have must be a configuration of physical matter (Atoms, electrons, the like) in the brain. So, when deciding for example what to eat for dinner, the brain goes through a series of thoughts (deliberation, decision), that means a series of physical states. Now, if we stay committed physicalists, this is all we have to prove. Since physical matter is competely determined, the thoughts are too. Therefore, the agent could not have done otherwise, which a problem libertarian free will cannot resolve.

## The non-physicalist expansion

So let us now stop being physicalists and posit some kind of other matter. This matter does not need to be determined by physical laws, or at all. Therefore, this matter could conceivably enable actors to be capable of agent causation. Possibly, thoughts are not physical, but are made of this second kind of matter. This thoughtmatter (this mind) could take all options into account and then decide on what it wants. Therefore, there were multiple options, and libertarian free will is possible. While technically true, this argument hides a fundamental problem: What does deciding mean? More precisely: how does the mind come to a decision?
Fundamentally, a decision could be random, but that is, as previously established, not freedom. It could also be a operation on data: The deciding function takes facts, evaluates them and returns a result. The facts of any situation are fundamentally unchangable. They might have been caused by a free decision in the past (a chain of causality started by a free action), but they themselves cannot make a decision free, since they are in the moment deterministic. The evaluation is what one would commonly point to as the place where free will can be found. While evaluating, one can either have reasons (be they intellectual or emotional) (One might also call the reasons the specific subset of one's personality relevant to the situation) for an action or do it "just because".
A reason might be a preference for sweet food or a desire to stay healthy. But how is having a reason for something free? Reasons must be based on events, thought processes... in the past. And while those could have been free, they again would not make this action any more free. Trying to find a reason for those decisions to be free, we would get stuck at the same point, pushing the cause back and back, until eventually it would be before our birth, before even our conception, an event we certainly cannot control. To put it differently, the answer to why these reasons are free, they need to be free without relying on some past event being free, they must be the cause of freedom in their own right. But since reasons necessarily reference the past (or the outside world, which does not lend itself to being freely controllable), this is impossible. This means that an agent could not have done otherwise, which makes the action un-free. One might be inclined to say a soul (without defining elements, since that would render ist into a different version of the problem of reasons from before). But what makes a soul with no characteristic parts, in effect, different from just random chance?

Taking all the options into account, we are forced in to the conclusion that libertarian free will is impossible in a incompatibilist framework.
